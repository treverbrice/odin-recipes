      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>combine half and half, eggs, honey, and salt into a bowl, whisk and
        set aside</li>
      <li>heat 10-inch skillet to medium high and melt butter</li>
      <li>soak bread in custard for 30 seconds each side</li>
      <li>cook 2 slices of bread in skillet, flipping after 2 minutes</li>
